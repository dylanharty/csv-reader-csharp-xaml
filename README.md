# csv-reader-csharp-xaml
Sait CSV program reader and writer

# Getting Started
1. Install Visual Studio 2019
2. Open project file `SaitProjectCSVDesktop.csproj`
3. Run using the play button

# Usage 
Open the program. It will display the CSV file in a ListView. Right Click on the ListVIew to display a context menu with Add and Remove program. To remove a program you must have one selected on your right click.

# Strcuture
Data folder contains the CSV file, copied to output folder on run. Classes folder contains class objects for the program.

# Notes
I decided to try my hand at C# and XAML as I have not coded in C# for over six months, and C# is allowed. Hopefully this qualifies as web technologies were not specified and the nature of the project seemed more desktop oriented. If you require more technical knowledge you can check out my AtomHash git repos below. If you require another project using other technolgies let me know and I will be happy to do that.
